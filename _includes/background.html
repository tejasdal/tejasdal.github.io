      I'm currently pursuing my master's in Applied Computer Science at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.dal.ca/" target="_blank">Dalhousie University</a> learning and implementing software engineering techniques.
       I graduated with my bachelor's degree from
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://ksv.ac.in/" target="_blank">KSV University</a> in 2018. I worked as a Programmer Analyst at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.meditab.com/" target="_blank">Meditab Software Company</a> for 1.5 years.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy learning software engineering techniques and working as a team to implement solutions for 
      challenging problems. My primary focus while building applications is to provide reliable, scalable and tested deliverables 
      within optimal time.

      <strong>When I'm away from keyboard</strong>, I'm probably having a non-alcoholic drink with friends, enjoying popcorn with 
      netflix and chill, or playing cricket.
